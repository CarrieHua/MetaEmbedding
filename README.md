# MetaEmbedding
Codes for our SIGIR-2019 paper: 

**[Warm Up Cold-start Advertisements: Improving CTR Predictions via Learning to Learn ID Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11547)**

This repo includes an example for training Meta-Embedding upon a deepFM model on the binarized MovieLens-1M dataset. The dataset is preprocessed and splitted already.
